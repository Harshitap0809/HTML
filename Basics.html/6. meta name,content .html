1. Makes pages responsive to all screen sizes.
   - Ensures mobile users see properly scaled content without manual zooming.
     - Example:
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html lang="en">
         <head>
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
           <title>Mobile Friendly Page</title>
         </head>
         <body>
           <h1>Welcome to the mobile-friendly page!</h1>
         </body>
       </html>
       NOTE - This ensures that content scales properly on smaller mobile screens without the need for zooming in.

2. Adjusts layout dynamically for tablets and desktops.
     - Example:
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html lang="en">
         <head>
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
           <title>Responsive Layout</title>
         </head>
         <body>
           <h1>Responsive Design Example</h1>
         </body>
       </html>
       NOTE - The `viewport` meta tag ensures that the layout adjusts for different screen sizes, from tablets to desktops.

3. Vital for improving user experience on different devices.
     - Example:
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html lang="en">
         <head>
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
           <title>Responsive UX</title>
         </head>
         <body>
           <h1>Optimized User Experience</h1>
         </body>
       </html>
       NOTE - The `viewport` meta tag ensures that users on all devices experience the site in an optimized way.

4. Reduces bounce rates by improving usability.Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who leave a webpage without interacting further, like clicking links or visiting other pages. 
   A high bounce rate often means the content or design isnâ€™t engaging, while a low bounce rate indicates users are exploring the site more.
     - Example:
       <!DOCTYPE html>
       <html lang="en">
         <head>
           <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
           <title>Better Usability</title>
         </head>
         <body>
           <h1>Improved Usability Example</h1>
         </body>
       </html>
       NOTE - A responsive site increases user engagement and decreases bounce rates by offering an intuitive experience across devices.
