-HTML was initially invented to publish research papers.
-All the tags in HTML are acting as a container.
-The way HTML tags are organized one after the other is called HTML hierarchy.
-The four most essential and widely used HTML tags that help web browsers to function properly are:
<html> < / html>
<head> < / head>
<title> < / title>
<body> < / body>
-Web servers are configured to pick up some of the file automatically example: index.html file.
-In earlier days, there used to be so many DOCTYPES because browser was serving so many of the documents i.e. HTML with different versions.
-Now it's just same which is <!DOCTYPE html>. It means the document that you are about to serve on web page is of the latest version i.e. HTML 5.
