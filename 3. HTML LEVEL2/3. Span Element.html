    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>

    <p>
      This is an example of the <span style="color: red">span</span> element in
      HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
      Notice that the word <span style="font-weight: bold">"span"</span> is
      bolded and <span style="font-style: italic">italicized</span> in this
      sentence.
    </p>

    <p>
      We can also combine multiple styles:
      <span style="color: blue; font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold"
        >This text is blue, larger, and bold</span
      >.
    </p>
