<!-- 
Input Element
Name Attribute:
- Name of the form control. Submitted with the form as part of the name/value pair.
- Name attribute is used to identify form data after it has been submitted to the server.
- example scenario: 
    - If you have a form with a text field for the user's name, you might give the text field a name attribute of "name".
    - When the form is submitted, the data in the text field is sent to the server with the name "name" and the value that the user entered. 
    - The server-side script can then use the name "name" to access the value that the user entered.
- Example : 
<input type="text" placeholder="enter name" id="username" name="username"/>
