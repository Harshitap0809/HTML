<!-- 
Form Elements:
2. Placeholders attribute
- placeholder simple means a hint or a suggestion to the user about what to enter in the input field. 
- e.g. <input type="text" placeholder="Enter your name">

<!-- 
Form Elements:
3. Labels attribute
- Label element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
- Label is also reponsible for screen readers.
- e.g. <label for="name">Name:</label>
- e.g. <label>
        Enter your username:
        <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="username">
       </label>

       - In the above example everything is written within a single label tag which actually forms a connection between the label and the input field.
       - If we write input field outside the label tag then there won't be any connection between the label and the input field.
- NOTE : You can also add 'id' which gives unique name to the element.

- #Label Classic approach
- <label for="username">Enter your username: </label>
  <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="username">
- To form a connection between the label and the input field, we must use 'for' attribute in the label tag and 'id' attribute in the input field.
