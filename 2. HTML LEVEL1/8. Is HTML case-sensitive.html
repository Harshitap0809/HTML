    <!-- 
    Facts about HTML case sensitivity:
    1. HTML tags are not case-sensitive, meaning <h1> and <H1> are treated the same.
    2. HTML attributes are also not case-sensitive, so 'id' and 'ID' are equivalent.
    3. It is a common practice to write HTML tags and attributes in lowercase for consistency and readability.
    4. XHTML, a stricter version of HTML, is case-sensitive and requires tags and attributes to be in lowercase.
    5. Browsers are designed to handle HTML in a case-insensitive manner to ensure compatibility and ease of use.
